You need to add your firebase app configuration in the `Firebase` directory.

Here is an example:

Filename: `firebase.config.js`
Code:

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR API KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR AUTH DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR PROJECT ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR STORAGE BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR MESSAGING SENDER ID",
  appId: "YOUR APP ID",
};

export default firebaseConfig;
```

Here is a live url for how that works:
